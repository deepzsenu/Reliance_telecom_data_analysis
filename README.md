The category of a stock is indicated in the ‘Series’ column. If the csv file has data on more than one category, the ‘Date’ column will have repeating values. To avoid repetitions in the date, remove all the rows where 'Series' column is NOT 'EQ'. Analyze and understand each column properly. You'd find the head(), tail() and describe() functions to be immensely useful for exploration. You're free to carry out any other exploration of your own.
